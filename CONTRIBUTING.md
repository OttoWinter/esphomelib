# Contributing to esphomelib

esphomelib is the C++ framework that powers the whole esphomelib project.

For a detailed guide, please see https://esphomelib.com/esphomeyaml/guides/contributing.html#contributing-to-esphomelib

Things to note when contributing:
 - Please test your changes :)
 - If a new feature is added or an existing user-facing feature is changed, you should also 
   update the [docs](https://github.com/OttoWinter/esphomedocs). See [contributing to esphomedocs](https://esphomelib.com/esphomeyaml/guides/contributing.html#contributing-to-esphomedocs)
   for more information.
 - Please also create a YAML counterpart of new features in [esphomeyaml](https://github.com/OttoWinter/esphomeyaml) so that more users
   can profit from it.
 - Sometimes I will let pull requests linger because I'm not 100% sure about them. Please feel free to ping
   me after some time.
